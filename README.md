# üí´ About Me:
I'm software developer. My interest is on latest technologies where I can improve my coding skills and improve real life problem skills. I am not in specific development like frontend or backend. I can work in various programming languages. The effective solution of every problem is break the problem into step by step. I am not kind of another developer like who think I am web developer that I cannot work in backend. My thinking that Logic is same in every where in any programming languages. but, there is different style to implement it. that's why I am focussing on problem statement not programming that's why I can work in any programming languages. but I am not fully experienced or not fully mature for solving problem, I am trying to solve the problem. My DSA is not good or well enough. I learned problem solving from the experience not DSA or any other things. Earlier I started my programming journey since 2018 with My Mentor (Mr. Manoj Chauhan), I learned Basic Web development (HTMl, CSS and JavaScript). than I learned Java (spring boot) React js, In 2023 I started to work with my mentor in project as an intern where I learn Angular.Js framework for build the web apps. I worked for 2 years as an intern after college I tried to get full time job but I did'nt get it. In March 2025, I was working as intern at samrish technologies but I got an opportunity for another company (OurBus Inc.) from the Samrish company. I have to work as a software developer for Ourbus company from the samrish. In Ourbus I managed website and backend project majorly work on frontend end sometimes in backend. also I maintained or development SEO things (like implement schema's, url redirection, meta tags, etc). Analysics logs from kibana, kubedash, and work on Microsoft Devops for releasing the feature or task management. I work with Marketing team and tech team. With the technical enhancement for SEO. Company get highest significant amount of revenue in the quarter(June to September). I am on notice period because of contract is about to end from samrish to ourbus.
